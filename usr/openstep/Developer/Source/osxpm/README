OSXPM - LuBu OpenStep 1.1.1
-----------------------------

OSXPM is a modified version of xpmroot, rewritten
to run without FVWM and the FVWM libs installed.
It is in fact a pretty quick and "dirty" hack, but
it does what it was made to do. The name was changed
from xpmroot to osxpm in order to further integrate
it into the OpenStep enviroment naming conventions.

OSXPM Requires only X11 and XPM installed.
Source is from the fvwm-2.0.46-beta release.
Binary is installed as /usr/openstep/bin/osxpm, and
the manpage as /usr/openstep/man/man1/osxpm.1
