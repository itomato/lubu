#  NeXT Makefile.preamble Template

#
#  This Makefile is used for configuring the standard app makefiles associated
#  with ProjectBuilder.  
#  
#  Use this template to set attributes for a project, sub-project, bundle, or
#  palette.  Each node in the project's tree of sub-projects and bundles 
#  should have it's own Makefile.preamble and Makefile.postamble.

## Configure the flags passed to $(CC) here.  These flags will also be 
## inherited by all nested sub-projects and bundles.  Put your -I, -D, -U, and
## -L flags here.  To change the default flags that get passed to ${CC} 
## (e.g. change -O to -O2), see Makefile.postamble.

# Flags passed to compiler (in addition to -g, -O, etc)

## Configure what is linked in at each level here.  Libraries are only used in
## the final 'app' linking step.  Final 'app' linking is only done via the
## 'app', 'debug', and 'profile' targets when they are invoked for
## the top-level app.

## Resources" in Project Builder) so that they will be compressed into .store

## need to also be in the app wrapper, then a cp command will need to be added
## in an after_install target.
