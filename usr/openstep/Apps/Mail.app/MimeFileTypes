#  MIME File Type Mapping Table
#
#  This file maps MIME content types to UNIX file extensions.  Where
#  there is multiple file extensions for a particular MIME type, the
#  first one will be used for incoming messages (and all for outgoing).
#
#  An incoming attachment with a MIME type not listed below will receive
#  a file extension from the MIME subtype with any possible "x-" prefix
#  removed.  An outgoing attachment with a file extension not listed
#  below will receive a MIME type of application/octet-stream.
#
#  A MIME subtype of "*" can be used to indicate that all incoming
#  attachments of that type should be mapped to the specified file
#  extension.  This does not effect outgoing attachments.
#
#  Finally, an entry with no file types indicates that the corresponding
#  MIME attachments should not be given any file type at all.  This only
#  affects incoming messages.
#
#  Note that the MIME type audio/basic is special and will only be
#  used if the sound file is 8 bit mu-law @ 8 KHz (or the file contains
#  raw data, which is assumed to be the same).
