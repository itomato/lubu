ABOUT THE STAROFFICE ICONS

The icons are created with elements from the Blueprint package
included with gnome2. The white base template is inspired by
some icons in the Kiwi package and is used as a base for almost
all of the LuBu OpenMagic 1.0 wrapper and application icons.
The final design is (C)2006 LuBu OpenMagic 1.0. Please read
the LuBu OpenMagic 1.0 copyright for information on copying.
