#
#     This file should contain an entry to start the server on the
#     local display. If you have more than one display (not screen),
#     add entries to the list (one per line).
#
#     If the local display has an associated character device, it should be
#     specified here also.  This allows Dtlogin to correctly monitor that
#     device when [No Windows] mode is selected from the login screen.  If
#     no character device is available, then "none" should be specified.
#
#     By default, the ":0" display is associated with the "/dev/console"
#     character device.  If the true console on the system is not the same
#     as the ":0" graphics display, then the appropriate device or "none"
#     should be specified for the ":0" display.
#
#     If you want multiple-displays running dtlogin then make sure the 
#     connection number matches the display name, for example.
#
# <HostName>:1 local@none /usr/openwin/bin/X :1 <options>
#
#     This means the X-server is started on connection number "1" and the 
#     display is connecting to the X-server on "1" through display name 
#     "LocalHost:1".
#
#     If you have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
#     you can add them here as well. Using XDMCP is recommended over
#     entries in this file and should be used whenever possible.
#
#     Example Syntax, the items between "< >" are optional: 
#
# <HostName>:0 <class> local@console           /usr/openwin/bin/X :0 <options>
# <HostName>:1 <class> local@none              /usr/openwin/bin/X :1 <options>
# <HostName>:0 <class> local_uid@console <uid> /usr/openwin/bin/X :0 <options>
#  XTermName:0 <class> foreign
#
#     A "*" in the first field of the entry for a local server 
#     will be expanded to "<hostname>:0" by Dtlogin. This
#     syntax is valid only within this file.
#
# * Local local@console /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 
#
#     If the display type of "local_uid" is used, a user name such as "root" 
#     must follow in next field.  In this example, by placing "root" here, 
#     Login will start a local Xserver under the user id of "root".  On Sun 
#     system's this will give Xserver the ability to raise interactive 
#     scheduling priority of a client with mouse/keyboard focus to increase 
#     performance of the application. 
#
# :0 Local local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 
#
#     In limited situations, the Xserver should not be run under a "root" id 
#     for security reasons.  Examples are usually specific to Xserver extensions.
#     On Sun Xservers one example involves the Display Postscript extension.  
#     If the DPS extension is granted access (via Xserver option line) to read
#     and write Unix files via the "-dpsfileops" option (see Xsun man page) it
#     should not be run under a "root" user id.  For increaseced security, 
#     could instead run it as the "nobody" user.
#
# :0 Local local_uid@console nobody /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 -dpsfileops 
#
#     Another options of interest here for Sun's Xserver is how to start on 
#     two or more screens.  A two screen example follows.
#
# :0 Local local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/X -dev /dev/fb0 -dev /dev/fb1
#
#     See the Xsun.1 and Xserver.1 man pages for additional options of 
#     interest.
