Hello New User, and welcome to LuBu OpenMagic 1.0! It is my hope
that you find this enhanced version of OpenStep enjoyable, easy
 to use, stable and even pleasing on the eyes.

The LuBu OpenMagic 1.0 Desktop Enviroment has in every possible
way been optimized for both avarage users and for powerusers,
meaning that no matter how much you pounder the desktop, it
still will not let you down! It was designed for beauty, for
speed, for ease of use and for your pleasure.

Included is a short document on customizing the desktop. It is
called Customizing_your_desktop.rtf and is located in your
UserApps folder (Available from your Browser Shelf).

Enjoy!

With Kind Regards
Luke Th. Bullock
( Developer / Maintainer )
