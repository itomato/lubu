Hintsfile for LuBu OpenMagic 1.0 and Soalris OpenStep 1.1-sparc

Hint #1:
-------
Make sure OpenMagic 1.0 / OpenStep 1.1 is installed in
/usr/openstep or at least exists as a symlink in order 
for everything to work correctly. If you install else-
where, and do not symlink to /usr/openstep, do not even
think of bothering me with bug-reports.

Hint #2:
-------
It is possible to hide directories from the browser with a simple
.hidden file. In the same way you can reveal files by removing their 
entry form the .hidden file.

root@teologia# cat /.hidden 
GNUstep
Mail
TT_DB
dev
devices
openstep
proc

Hint #3:
-------
There are hidden settings in the standard applications.
Use strings <file> to read. Use /usr/openstep/bin/dwrite
to set the values. You are on your own here, so use with
care. Also, check out the file included in this directory
for hidden Mail values, and for the syntax of dwrite.
(Mail-hidden-defaults)

Hint #4:
-------
You can assign different icons to your directories by placing
a tiff file there as .dir.tiff - make sure all tiff files are
set to 72dpi else they will look distorted.

Hint #5:
-------
Make sure all files in /usr/openstep are owned by bin:bin
else you will loose alot of functionality! There is NO NEED
for ANY of the files to be owned by root (other than possibly
Preferences.app/set_password which is initially broken due to
a missing library). See the READ_ME_FIRST file for more info.

Hint #6:
-------
Read ALL the documents under /usr/openstep/Information before
sending bug-reports or suggesting changes. There might be a 
good reason why feature <insert feature here> is missing.

Hint #7:
-------
You can get most apps that belong under /usr/openstep/LocalApps/XVIEW
as both / either source or in binary form from the following sites:

XVIEW  : http://physionet.org/physiotools/xview/
XVIEW includes the source for the OPEN LOOK enviroment and some 
extra apps.

OWacomp: http://www.freshmeat.net/projects/owacomp
         ftp://step.polymtl.ca/pub/Xview/OWacomp
OWacomp includes just about everything you need for running XVIEW,
in both binary and source form. Apps, libs, source, GUI development
and lots more. A MUST have for retro-fans.
