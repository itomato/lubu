      Installation
        Do I need to install the OpenWin packages in 2.5? 
        No, the Solaris 2.5 version of OpenWindows already has the updated 
        PostScript operators. You will want to install the font patch, though. 
        Do I need a license to run OpenStep applications? 
        No, you only need a license to use the Objective C compiler. However, 
        you will need the OpenStep runtime libraries to use any applications you 
        develop. 
        What patches do I need to install? 
        The following patches are required to be installed before OpenStep can 
        run: 
          Solaris 2.4 
          101242-10 libC patch
          101923-08 SMCC TCX jumbo patch (24 bit framebuffer) ##
          !! Only in Solaris 2.4 !!
          OpenWindows 3.4.1 SUNWxwinc SUNWxwmod SUNWxwplt SUNWxwslb 
          Solaris 2.5 
          103073-01 SMCC TCX jumbo patch (24 bit framebuffer) ##
          103246-03 OpenWindows 3.5 font patch
          ## - only required when running on sparc 5's 
        I'd like to use CDE, how can I make it work with OpenStep? 
        OpenStep now comes with a specific package to enable an OpenStep login 
        from CDE. You need to add the SUNWOosUy package, which can be found on 
        the solaris_openstep cd-rom. 
        After you've installed the OpenStep CDE package, you'll need restart 
        your computer for the changes to take effect. Once you've logged in to 
        your OpenStep session, make sure that "More Colors to Applications" is 
        selected in your CDE style manager. 
      Starting OpenStep
        I get a 'symbol not found: _ex_keylock' from ld.so. 
        You need to install patch #101242-10. 
        How do I start OpenStep on my 24 bit display. 
        You need to explicitly tell the X server to start in a 24 bit display 
        mode. If you don't, it will start in 8 bit, even on a 24 bit display. 
        Here are some examples: 
        From a shell:
        openwin -dpi 72 -dev /dev/fb0 defdepth 24 defclass TrueColor 
        From your .login:
        $OPENWINHOME/bin/openwin -dpi 72 -dev /dev/fb0 defdepth 24 defclass 
        TrueColor 
        A dual headed SX/GX system:
        $OPENWINHOME/bin/openwin -dev /dev/fb1 left dpix 72 dpiy 72
        defdepth 24 defclass TrueColor -dev /dev/fb0 right dpix 72
        dpiy 72 defdepth 8 defclass PseudoColor >&! /tmp/ow.errors 
        These windows still look like olwm/motif! 
        You need to use the oswm window manager.
        Here's how:
        In your .cshrc or .login file:
        setenv OW_WINDOW_MANAGER /usr/openstep/bin/oswm 
        or if you run Bourne shell: 
        set OW_WINDOW_MANAGER /usr/openstep/bin/oswm
        export OW_WINDOW_MANAGER
        Re-source your .cshrc or .login and restart your openwin. 
        The fonts look terrible, how can I fix them? 
        You need the OpenWindows 3.5 font patch. If you're running the 3.4.1 
        OpenWindow server, its already been patched. 
        I get the error: 'FATAL ERROR: datagram init failure' 
        This is probably due to a conflict with NeXT's PDO product. Whats 
        happening is this; some other process is grabbing port 7656 before ospd 
        does. Here is a quick way to check. Before starting OpenStep, do the 
        following: 
        netstat -a | grep 7656 
        If you see any output at all, port 7656 is in use. The only fix for this 
        is to find the offending process and stop it from running. 
        Unfortunately you can't run both PDO and OpenStep on the same machine at 
        the same time, the following is the best explanation I've run across:"We 
        had to change the implementation of the machd that we started with from 
        PDO2.0 in order to make it work correctly; basically in didn't support 
        multiply-threaded clients; in doing the implementation we had to change 
        the protocol between OpenStep client apps and machd(now called ospd); It 
        is now different than the protocol between a PDO client and its machd. 
        While we could change the TCP port that is used to by the client the 
        connect to a local ospd (and in fact I think we may have done that 
        anticipating this problem); the fact that all netmsgservers and machd 
        use the same well known UDP port for talking over the wire, means that 
        we really can't run both an ospd and a machd from PDO on the same host 
        at the same time. 
        So, I don't believe there is a way to run NEO OpenStep and PDO on the 
        same host at the same time; You certainly can on the same network; And 
        our DO objects will talk to PDO as well as NeXT DO objects in 4.0 will, 
        because we are in synch with their implementation there." 
        How can I optimize colors on a 24 bit system that runs CDE? 
        To workaround the color problems on the 24-bit systems, make a backup 
        copy of /etc/dt/config/Xservers and change the last line in your 
        /etc/dt/config/Xservers file to:
          Local local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun -nobanner -dpi 72 
          -dev /dev/fb0 defclass TrueColor defdepth 24 
        And then reboot your computer. NOTE: This change will not take effect 
        until you kill and restart your dtlogin program or reboot your CPU. This 
        change will cause your X server to started up in default 24-bit mode. 
        This worksaround a problem in the OpenStep appkit where it allocates 
        entries in the default 8-bit colormap even when you have a 24-bit 
        server. If this does not work, revert to the backup copy of Xservers. 
        Where is my mail? I used OpenStep's mail and all the new messages are 
        gone. 
        OpenStep's Mail.app removes mail messages from /var/mail and stores them 
        in ~/openstep/Mailboxes/Active.mbox/mbox, unlike other mail programs 
        used within Sun. To recover the messages, copy 
        ~/openstep/Mailboxes/Active.mbox/mbox to /var/mail/$Username. The mail 
        can then be read with another program. 
        How can I reduce Solaris OpenStep's color usage in the default 8-bit 
        color map? 
        By default, OpenStep uses about 200 colors in the default 8-bit color 
        map. Change the .Xdefaults file in your home directory to match one of 
        the following examples. This will reduce OpenStep's color map usage. 
              DPSColorCube.PseudoColor.8.reds:5
              DPSColorCube.PseudoColor.8.greens:6
              DPSColorCube.PseudoColor.8.blues:2
              DPSColorCube.PseudoColor.8.grays:7

        The above values will yield good OpenStep graphics, while=20 using only 
        67 of the default 8-bit colormap. The next example provides even further 
        reductions. 
              DPSColorCube.PseudoColor.8.reds:3
              DPSColorCube.PseudoColor.8.greens:4
              DPSColorCube.PseudoColor.8.blues:2
              DPSColorCube.PseudoColor.8.grays:7

        The above values will yield fair OpenStep graphics, while using only 35 
        colors of the default 8-bit colormap. You can increase the number of 
        grays to 13 to improve gray shadings. 
        The number of color map entries used can be determined by 
          colors entries used = (reds * greens * blues) + grays 
        The above configurations will reduce the number of colors used by 
        OpenStep when running under OSWM or DTWM (CDE). 
        The xcolor tool (GUI) can be used to display the default color cube. The 
        xdpyinfo tool (command line) can be used to view system display 
        information. 
        Why does increasing the number of grays not improve the dock icon 
        images? 
        The dock icon background is not gray. Rather it is a gradation, or an 
        off-gray color and is dithered. We are looking into changing the dock 
        icon background to pure gray in a future release.
