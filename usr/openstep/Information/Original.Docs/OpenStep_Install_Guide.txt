OpenStep(TM) Installation Guide

      3 Configuring and Starting the OpenStepTM Environment 



      This chapter describes how to configure the user's environment to run 
      OpenStep under OpenWindows or the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). 
        Setting OpenStep Environment Variables 
        Configuring for OpenWindows 
        Configuring for CDE 
        Starting the OpenStep Desktop 
        Stopping the OpenStep Desktop 
      Setting OpenStep Environment Variables 
      For both OpenWindows and CDE installations, make the following environment 
      variable changes: 
        1. Login as the user of the computer. 
        2. Set the user's search, man pages, and AnswerBook paths.

        Bourne shell:
        PATH=$PATH:/usr/openstep/bin
        MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/openstep/man
        AB_CARDCATALOG=$AB_CARDCATALOG:\
        /opt/SUNWOabos/ab_cardcatalog:\
        /opt/SUNWOabwo/ab_cardcatalog
        export PATH
        export MANPATH
        export AB_CARDCATALOG

        C shell:
        setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/openstep/bin
        setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:/usr/openstep/man
        setenv AB_CARDCATALOG ${AB_CARDCATALOG}:\
        /opt/SUNWOabos/ab_cardcatalog:\
        /opt/SUNWOabwo/ab_cardcatalog 
      Note that /opt/SUNWOabwo_cardcatalog is needed only if WorkShop OpenStep 
      is installed. 
      Configuring for OpenWindows 
      Make the following change for to run OpenStep under OpenWindows: 
        1. Locate the line in the user's .login or .profile file that invokes 
        OpenWindows. It should look like: 
          openwin 
        or 
          $OPENWINHOME/bin/openwin 
        Change the line so it looks like one of the following: 
          openwin -dpi 72 <your options here> 
        or 
          $OPENWINHOME/bin/openwin -dpi 72 <your options here> 
        Replace <your options here> with any OpenWindows switches that your 
        installation already uses. 
        2. If you want OpenStep to be automatically invoked on user login, then 
        replace the line that invokes OpenWindows with the following code: 
        Bourne shell: 
        if [-f /usr/openstep/etc/Xinitrc ] 
        then
        XINITRC=/usr/openstep/etc/Xinitrc
        openwin -dpi 72 <your options here>
        unset XINITRC
        else 
        openwin <your options here>
        fi 
        C shell: 
        if (-e /usr/openstep/etc/Xinitrc) then
        setenv XINITRC /usr/openstep/etc/Xinitrc
        openwin -dpi 72 <your options here>
        unsetenv XINITRC
        else
        openwin <your options here>
        endif 
        OpenStep will now start on user login. 
        3. logout and login. 
      If the user has a printer physically attached to the computer, configure 
      the printer for OpenStep Desktop as described by "Starting the OpenStep 
      Desktop". 
      Configuring for CDE 
      The machine's CDE environment is configured by installing the CDE package 
      (see "Installing the CDE Package"). To run OpenStep under CDE, select 
      "OpenStep" from the login menu. 
      Caution - Please be aware that under CDE your .login/.profile is not read 
      by default. This means that any application started from the dock may not 
      have access to the environment variables it needs. You may configure CDE 
      to read in your shell environment variables by configuring your 
      $HOME/.dtprofile file. Please see "Solaris CDE Installation and System 
      Administration Guide" and "CDE Advanced User's and System Administrator's 
      Guide" for details. 
      Note - If CDE 1.0 is installed, make sure you select "More Colors to 
      Applications" in the Style Manager. To avoid colormap problems, startup 
      OpenStep before starting up any other color rich application (for example, 
      FrameMaker, Adobe Acrobat). 
      Starting the OpenStep Desktop 
      This section is useful if you have chosen to start OpenStep manually, or 
      you have shut down OpenStep and want to restart it. 
      The openstep command is used to manually start up and shut down the 
      OpenStep desktop once the window system is started. The following text 
      lists several common openstep command forms: 
        openstep 
        Starts the basic desktop: daemons (ospd, ospbs), Dock (Workspace.app) 
        and FileViewer (WM.app). 
        openstep -ShowDock NO 
        Starts the basic desktop, but the Dock (Workspace.app) is not visible. 
        This would be the common mode of operation for running OpenStep under a 
        CDE environment. 
        openstep -start program 
        Startup the basic desktop and also run the executable program. 
      Stopping the OpenStep Desktop 
      The openstep command takes the following options for shutdown: 
        openstep -stop 
        Shutdown the entire openstep desktop. This will also shutdown the X 
        server unless the special user default has been set to disable that 
        behavior as described below. 
      To stop OpenStep, enter the appropriate command in an xterm window. All 
      OpenStep applications will terminate, followed by termination of the 
      windowing environment, returning the user to the native non-windowed 
      Solaris prompt. 
      If you want the X server windowing environment left running but want all 
      OpenStep applications shutdown, enter the following command once in a 
      terminal window: 
        % dwrite Workspace TerminateWindowManager NO 
      Once you have entered this command, you need not enter it again. Future 
      openstep -stop commands will not terminate the windowing environment.
