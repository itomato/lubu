KNOWN_BUGS in Solaris OpenStep 1.1-sparc
----------------------------------------

Binary format and OS compability:
 Sun Solaris Sparc / 32bit & 64bit (OpenStep is 32bit only)

All OpenStep 1.1 files are:
 "ELF 32-bit MSB executable SPARC Version 1, dynamically linked, stripped"
 All binaries have been stripped. Minimum requirements are at least 128MB
 of RAM, and any Solaris Sparc 5/6/7/8/9 release, and 10 up to, and only
 partially including Solaris 10/305, which gives symbol reference errors
 in Mail.app, though all other apps seem to work. Higher versions than 
 Solaris 10/305 have not been tested.

Workspace Bug:
 Do NOT under any circumstance change the animation rate in Workspace.defs
 to 0 (Zero)! The current value is set to "10" (AnimationRate = 10;), which 
 gives the Workspace a feeling of speed and efficiency. There is a (serious?)
 bug in the AnimationRate feature that will render both the Browser and the
 Dock useless if the value is set to 0 (Zero). You will NOT be able to move
 appicons, and there will be ghost images left on your screen which will not 
 go away untill you log out! If you wish to play with that setting, do it on
 a user basis and not on a global basis. Any value from 1 - 10 should work.

Example using the drite utility:
 youruser@yourhost$ dwrite Workspace AnimationRate 5

Missing Library (libauth.so.1):
 In Solaris releases higher that 2.6 the library libauth.so.1 is missing.
 The Preferences.app application set_password requires this library. Sun
 seems to have removed it from releases later that 2.6, probably due to a
 buffer overflow in the library. I have included Suns 106569-01 patch in
 the directory libauth.patch, but I refuse to include it in the default
 install due to the nature of the bug. You are definitly on your own if
 you choose to install a known security risk onto your system. 
 - You have been warned -

        libsecdb.so.1 =>         /lib/libsecdb.so.1
        libmp.so.2 =>    /lib/libmp.so.2
        libcmd.so.1 =>   /lib/libcmd.so.1
        libm.so.2 =>     /lib/libm.so.2

        /platform/SUNW,Ultra-5_10/lib/libmd5_psr.so.1

Wrappers:
 The Wrapper __header files are incredibly vulnerable to changes. Please
 note the following format the __headers need to work correct:
Filename:
 AppName.app/__ICONS/__header
Syntax:
 F<TAB>AppName.app<TAB>AppName<TAB>app
 F<TAB>AppName<TAB>AppName<TAB>app
For helpers add: (S-tab-extention-app-iconfile)
 S<TAB>xt<TAB>AppName<TAB>icon

If your file looks corrects, but the icon does not show, or the apps
 appears to "hang", take another look at the __header file with a binary
 editor. It may LOOK right, but remember that whitespace is not always
 considered as "empty" space. The icons MUST be named "app", and be in
 TIFF format, at 72dpi, otherwise they will not work.

CPU.app:
 The demo CPU.app does not work on UltraSparc platforms as it dies with 
 a bus error. It has been tested on both UltraSparc 1 (U1) and UltraSparc
 IIi (U5_10).
